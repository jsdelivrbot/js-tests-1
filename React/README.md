Organizations are struggling to defend their networks in the face of overwhelming complexity, lack of personnel and an increasing overload of false positives.

[Niddel](http://www.niddel.com/) revolutionizes the Threat Hunting landscape by introducing Magnet, the first Autonomous Threat Hunting System that automates the way human analysts would hunt for compromised or infected machines in a network.

Our technology focuses on breach detection, signaling machines in your network that are highly likely to be compromised or infected for investigation.
